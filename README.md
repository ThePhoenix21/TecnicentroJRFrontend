This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

> **Note:** The frontend runs on port 3001 and connects to the backend API on port 3000.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Configuration

### Ports
- **Frontend (Next.js):** Port 3001
- **Backend API:** Port 3000

The frontend application connects to the backend API running on port 3000. Make sure both services are running simultaneously for the application to work properly.

### Environment Variables
You can override the API URL by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# Example: Connect to a different backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```
